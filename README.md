# Hey, I'm Rohan 👋

Master's student in Computer Science at Northeastern University's Roux Institute | AI/ML Engineer | Full-Stack Developer

I'm passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems—from speech translation and computer vision to machine learning pipelines. Currently working on speech-to-speech translation systems for multilingual banking applications and exploring the intersection of AI and user experience.
